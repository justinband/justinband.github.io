# Hosting a Resume on GitHub Pages

## Purpose
Describe and use the concepts outlined in Andrew Etter's book _Modern Technical Communication_ to host a resume on GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

- A resume formatted in markdown

- A GitHub account

- Basic knowledge of Git

## Instructions

#### Setup

The following steps can be found at the [GitHub Pages website](https://pages.github.com/).

These steps assume that you're creating a brand new repository.

1. Create a public repository on GitHub named `username.github.io` where "username" is your actual GitHub username. For example, my repository is called `justinband.github.io`.

2. Using a command line, clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
    ```
3. Copy your resume into the repository folder.
    
4. Change the name of your resume to `index.md`. If preferred, `index.html` will also work.

5. Use Git to push your resume (`index.md`) to GitHub

    ```
    git add *
    git commit -m "Added index.md"
    git push -u origin master
    ```

6. In a browser, go to `https://username.github.io`.

After following these steps your resume will be hosted on GitHub Pages. If you run into issues please refer to the [FAQ](#faq)
#### Customization

Customizing your GitHub Pages site can be simple or become incredibly complex. The reason being is that GitHub Pages uses Jekyll, a tool used to create static websites. How your site looks can be changed by using Jekyll, but alas, I won't cover that here. If you want to know more I recommend checking out the Jekyll tutorials in the [more resources section](#more-resources).

However, GitHub Pages comes with some built-in Jekyll templates to change the style and layout of your site. To do this:

1. Go to the repository settings

2. Scrolling down, find the **GitHub Pages** section and click **Change theme**

3. Choose a theme from the list and then press **Select theme**

#### More Resources

- There are a variety of markdown tutorials online, however, I recommend this [one](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

## FAQ

Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
- Markdown is better than word processors at making fast and legible documents. Markdown files are flexible that can be easily converted to other widely used filetypes including: XML, HTML, and JSON. Moreover, these filetypes can be easily rendered by websites without the required overhead when using DOCX or PDF filetypes.

Why is my resume not showing up?
- It can be a few things:
    - Ensure that the filename of your resume is `index.md` or `README.md`. GitHub Pages prioritizes displaying `index.md` (`index.html` works too) so if you want a README your resume should be `index.md`.
    - Ensure that the source for your GitHub Pages site is being built from the correct branch. This option can be found in the **GitHub Pages** section of your repository settings.
